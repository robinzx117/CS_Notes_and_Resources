Internet Protocol(IP):
    -is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internet working, and
     essentially establishes the Internet. IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the packet
     headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram
     with source and destination information.

Internet Protocol address(IP address):
    -is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host
     or network interface identification and location addressing.

Internet Protocol version 4(IPv4):
    -IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space which provides 4,294,967,296 (2^32) unique addresses, but large blocks are reserved for special networking methods.
     Address range: 0.0.0.0–255.255.255.255

Internet Protocol version 6(IPv6):
    -In IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2^128 addresses.

network host:
    -is a computer or other device connected to a computer network. A host may work as a server offering information resources, services, and applications to users or other
     hosts on the network. Hosts are assigned at least one network address.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP):
    -is an application layer protocol which is used to provide:
         Subnet Mask(Option 1 – e.g., 255.255.255.0)
         Router Address(Option 3 – e.g., 192.168.1.1)
         DNS Address(Option 6 – e.g., 8.8.8.8)
         Vendor Class Identifier(Option 43 – e.g., 'unifi' = 192.168.1.9 ##where unifi = controller)
    -is based on a client-server model and based on discovery, offer, request, and ACK.
    -DHCP port number for server is 67 and for the client is 68. It is a client-server protocol which uses UDP services. IP address is assigned from a pool of addresses.
     In DHCP, the client and the server exchange mainly 4 DHCP messages in order to make a connection, also called DORA process, but there are 8 DHCP messages in the process.

Ping:
    -is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol(IP) network. It is available for virtually all
     operating systems that have networking capability, including most embedded network administration software.
     Ping measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. The name comes from active sonar
     terminology that sends a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water.
     Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) echo request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply. The program reports errors,
     packet loss, and a statistical summary of the results, typically including the minimum, maximum, the mean round-trip times, and standard deviation of the mean.

ipconfig:
    -is a console application program of some computer operating systems that displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration
     Protocol(DHCP) and Domain Name System(DNS) settings.

tcpdump:
    -is a data-network packet analyzer program that runs under a command line interface. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received
     over a network to which the computer is attached.

Wireshark:
    -is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development.

traceroute:
    -is a network tool used to show the route taken by packets across an IP network. It will show you each hop sequentially, and total hops required. For each hop, it will
     display the hop#, roundtrip times, best time (ms), IP address, TTL, and country. Seeing the traceroute information can help you determine why your connections to a given
     server might be poor and can help you identify problems. It also shows you how systems are connected to each other, letting you see how your ISP connects to the Internet
     as well as how the target system is connected.

netstat:
    -is a command line network utility that displays network connections for TCP, routing tables, and a number of network interface and network protocol statistics.
